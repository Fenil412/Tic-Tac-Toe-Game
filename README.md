# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This Tic-Tac-Toe game is a basic implementation of the classic two-player game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns marking either "X" or "O" on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to get three of the same symbol in a row, column, or diagonal. If all boxes are filled without a winner, the game results in a draw.

The gameâ€™s layout is created using HTML, with buttons representing the grid cells, and CSS is used to style the grid and make it visually appealing and responsive across different devices. JavaScript handles the game logic, including turn switching between players, winner detection based on pre-defined winning patterns, and detecting a draw if the grid is full.

Interactive features include real-time updates of player moves, winner announcements, and a reset button to restart the game. The game also includes visual feedback, such as highlighting the winning combination when a player wins and showing messages for both wins and draws.

This simple project demonstrates key web development concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game mechanics, making it an excellent starting point for beginners in web development. It combines ease of use with a responsive and user-friendly design, allowing players to enjoy a quick, interactive experience on any device.
