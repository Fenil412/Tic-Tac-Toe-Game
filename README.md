# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This Tic-Tac-Toe game is a basic implementation of the classic two-player game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns marking either "X" or "O" on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to get three of the same symbol in a row, column, or diagonal. If all boxes are filled without a winner, the game results in a draw.
